Split our simple game into a game loop and separating the model, view, and controller

Week of 2/9/2022
Worked on in-class material and played around with the base code to understand JavaScript. I also created a very basic mini-game that has a cube that flies across the screen
and the objective is to get it through the other gate. It is still buggy, but my goal for next week is to fix the bugs and format it so all the classes and objects are 
properly split up.
